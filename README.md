# qlikview-svn
Trying out source control with a fictional Qlikview project

# Goal
Finding out whether git can be used for this purpose. The nature of Qlikview is to save it's files as binaries, making it hard to use git. There is a way to store Qlikview documents into separate non-binary files (txt, xml). I'm using this repository to find out whether this will be workable.
